# math 
A)  Finding root of the equation using Bisection method. 
    
   1) python3  bisection.py (write on terminal and hit enter to run the script) 
   2) enter expression:     (enter your expression) 
   3) Then it will ask you to choose what kind of correction you want,
      enter 1 for "decimal" correction and enter 2 for "significant figures". 
   4) Then it will ask you to enter the value of "x" and also ask you to 
      lock it or not. 
      typing 'y' will lock the value of x
      typing 'n' will not lock the value x
   5) Since the value of x need to be such that the value of f(x) should be negative and 
      and positive respectively. After locking twice the value of x it will start  
      calculating the root of equation.  
      Be carefull if you lock the value x such that which gives the value of f(x) same  
      in both the attempts, then it may give you error or wrong answer.
